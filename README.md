## Description
Formula 1 Standings Website is a huge project for me. Official Formula 1 website provides informations about World Championship standings in an inelegant way. 
I wanted to make an enviroment which allows the end user to seek for necessary informations and feel like he's at home. Formula 1 Standings Website shares official Formula 1
World Championship standings for last twenty years of competition.
